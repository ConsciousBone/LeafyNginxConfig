# Leafy Nginx Config
This repo contains the config for the OpenRouter API proxy used in my Siege Week 8 project, Leafy.  

*If you're looking for Leafy itself, this is the wrong repo*.  
Apologies if the commits here are all over the place, Git/GitHub on Linux is weird and I'm building this from the Proxmox VM that's going to run this config :/
